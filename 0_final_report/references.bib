	abstract = {Situated in between supervised learning and unsupervised learning, the paradigm of reinforcement learning deals with learning in sequential decision making problems in which there is limited feedback. This text introduces the intuitions and concepts behind Markov decision processes and two classes of algorithms for computing optimal behaviors: reinforcement learning and dynamic programming. First the formal framework of Markov decision process is defined, accompanied by the definition of value functions and policies. The main part of this text deals with introducing foundational classes of algorithms for learning optimal behaviors, based on various definitions of optimality with respect to the goal of learning sequential decisions. Additionally, it surveys efficient extensions of the foundational algorithms, differing mainly in the way feedback given by the environment is used to speed up learning, and in the way they concentrate on relevant parts of the problem. For both model-based and model-free settings these efficient extensions have shown useful in scaling up to larger problems.},

	abstract = {This paper proposes a novel method to improve accuracy and speed for traveling salesman problem (TSP). A novel hysteretic noisy frequency conversion sinusoidal chaotic neural network (HNFCSCNN) with improved energy function is proposed for TSP to improve the solution quality and reduce the computational complexity. HNFCSCNN combines chaotic searching, stochastic wandering with hysteretic dynamics for better global searching ability. A specific activation function with two hysteretic loops in different directions is adopted to relieve the adverse impact caused by higher noise for frequency conversion sinusoidal chaotic neural network (FCSCNN). A new modified energy function for TSP which has lower computational complexity than the previous energy function is established. The simulation results show that the proposed HNFCSCNN can increase the optimization accuracy and speed of FCSCNN at higher noises, and that the proposed energy function can decrease the runtime of optimal computation. It has better optimization performance than the other several algorithms.},

@article{Hopfield:1985aa,
	abstract = {Highly-interconnected networks of nonlinear analog neurons are shown to be extremely effective in computing. The networks can rapidly provide a collectively-computed solution (a digital output) to a problem on the basis of analog input information. The problems to be solved must be formulated in terms of desired optima, often subject to constraints. The general principles involved in constructing networks to solve specific problems are discussed. Results of computer simulations of a network designed to solve a difficult but well-defined optimization problem-the Traveling-Salesman Problem-are presented and used to illustrate the computational power of the networks. Good solutions to this problem are collectively computed within an elapsed time of only a few neural time constants. The effectiveness of the computation involves both the nonlinear analog response of the neurons and the large connectivity among them. Dedicated networks of biological or microelectronic neurons could provide the computational capabilities described for a wide class of problems having combinatorial complexity. The power and speed naturally displayed by such collective networks may contribute to the effectiveness of biological information processing.},

	abstract = {The automobile industry is showing increasing interest in eco-friendly electric vehicles (EVs) with the aim of replacing vehicles that rely on traditional fossil fuels for energy. This study investigates the routing of an EV with maximum efficiency relative to the terrain. As EVs have poor climbing ability due to limitations associated with battery efficiency, this study determines the optimal route using 3D spatial information data and the slope of each link in the route. In the transportation field, the Bureau of Public Roads function classifies the shortest paths and optimizes paths. By adding slope-related variables, a new functional expression that includes weighting as a result of slope-related speed reduction is constructed, and a new functional expression system and network are built. As a result of assigning a route to optimize battery efficiency, the energy efficiency was improved by 7.84 km/kWh at an average speed of 70 km/h. The effectiveness was verified by comparing the total travel time and energy efficiency differences between the two methods. The proposed approach enables efficient transport and ultimately achieves the goal of green transportation with maximum energy efficiency.},

@article{battery_predict,
	abstract = { Drivers of battery electric vehicles (BEVs) require an accurate and reliable energy consumption prediction along a chosen route to reduce range anxiety. The energy consumption for a future trip depends on a number of factors such as driving behavior, road topography information, weather conditions and traffic situation. This paper discusses an algorithm to predict the energy consumption for a future trip considering these influencing factors. The route information is obtained from OpenStreetMap and Shuttle Radar Topography Mission. The algorithm consists of an offline algorithm and an online algorithm. The offline algorithm is designed to provide information for the driver to make future driving plans, which provides a nominal energy consumption value and an energy consumption range before a trip begins. The online algorithm is designed to adjust the energy consumption prediction result based on current driving, which includes a vehicle parameter estimation algorithm and a driving behavior correction algorithm. The energy consumption prediction algorithm is verified by 30 driving tests, including city, rural, highway and hilly driving. A comparison shows that the measured energy consumption of all trips is within the energy consumption range provided by the offline algorithm and most of the differences between the measurement and nominal prediction are smaller than 10\%. The offline prediction is used as a starting point and is corrected by the online algorithm during driving. The mean absolute percentage error between the measured energy consumption value and online prediction result of all trips is within 5\%. },

@article{VANBEVERN2020118,
	abstract = {One of the most fundamental results in combinatorial optimization is the polynomial-time 3/2-approximation algorithm for the metric traveling salesman problem. It was presented by Christofides in 1976 and is well known as ``the Christofides algorithm''. Recently, some authors started calling it ``Christofides-Serdyukov algorithm'', pointing out that it was published independently in the USSR in 1978. We provide some historic background on Serdyukov's findings and a translation of his article from Russian into English.
Одним из самых фундаментальных результатов в области комбинаторной оптимизации является полиномиальный 3/2-приближённый алгоритм для метрической задачи коммивояжёра. Он был представлен Никосом Кристофидесом в 1976г. и хорошо известен под названием <<алгоритм Кристофидеса>>. В последнее время некоторые авторы стали называть его <<алгоритмом Кристофидеса-Сердюкова>>, утверждая, что он был опубликован независимо в СССР в 1978г. В этой статье рассматривается исторический контекст появления результата А. И. Сердюкова и приводится перевод его статьи с русского на английский язык.},

@article{branch_elimination,
	abstract = {Travelling salesman problem (TSP) has been widely studied for the classical closed loop variant but less attention has been paid to the open loop variant. Open loop solution has property of being also a spanning tree, although not necessarily the minimum spanning tree (MST). In this paper, we present a simple branch elimination algorithm that removes the branches from MST by cutting one link and then reconnecting the resulting subtrees via selected leaf nodes. The number of iterations equals to the number of branches (b) in the MST. Typically, b &lt;&lt; n where n is the number of nodes. With O-Mopsi and Dots datasets, the algorithm reaches gap of 1.69% and 0.61 %, respectively. The algorithm is suitable especially for educational purposes by showing the connection between MST and TSP, but it can also serve as a quick approximation for more complex metaheuristics whose efficiency relies on quality of the initial solution.},

@article{Riabko_2022,
	abstract = {The article discusses the solution of the spatial traveling salesman problem (TSP 3D variation) using Ant Colony Optimization (ACO). The traveling salesman problem considers n bridges and a matrix of pairwise distances between them. It is necessary to find such an order of visiting cities so that the total distance traveled was minimal, each city was visited exactly once and the salesman returned to the city from which he began his route. In the TSP 3D variation problem, each ``city'' has 3 coordinates x, y, z. The analysis of the main methods of solving, in particular, the metaheuristic algorithms to which ACO belongs, is performed. At each iteration of these methods, a new solution of the problem is built, which is based not on one, but several solutions of the population. The ACO uses an idea that is based on collecting statistical information about the best solutions. The program code is implemented in MATLAB. During computational experiments, various network topologies were randomly generated, and the number of iterations at which the optimal cycle was achieved was recorded. The execution time of the code for the TSP 3D task is almost the same as the execution time of TSP 2D. The results can be used for spatial tasks of the salesman (TSP 3D-variation), which arise in the process of 3D printing, planning UAV trajectories (UAV) in mountain conditions or multi-story urban development, road planning in multi-story buildings.},
