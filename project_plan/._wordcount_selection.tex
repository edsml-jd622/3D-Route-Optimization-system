Traveling Salesman Problem (TSP) is route optimization for minimize the path given a series of locations.
The extensions of the route optimisation problem can be optimizing for minimum fuel/battery consumption, emissions, traveling time and so on.
The project is an external project from SnooCode, the aim of this project is to design a route optimisation system for a delivery company whose transportation is battery bikes with elevation in considering.\\

The project is split into two parts, one part is data processing and model developing, the other one is route optimisation algorithms.
This subproject is the first part, the main objectives of this subproject are: developing a 3D-road network for Accra combining the 2D-road network and raster elevation data, 
developing an electric bike model with python which can be used to calculate battery consumption and traveling time, 
combining the 3D-road network and e-bikes model then adding several attributes into it to yield a whole model.
After the model is developed, it can be combined with route optimisation algorithm, and determine the best route for delivery company for different optimisation goal: shortest path, minimum battery consumption, traveling time and so on.

More details about the project, progress to date and the future plan are introduced in this project plan.
